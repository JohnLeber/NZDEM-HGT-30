# NZDEM-HGT-30

New Zealand Digital elevation Model in 1 arc-second (~30 meter) HGT format. It is intended as a resource for the PC gaming community (train, plane, ship simulators...), graphics artists, or anyone who can apply the data safely.

I created the dataset back around 2010. At that time NASA has not released 30m SRTM data for New Zealand or for any countries other than the United States. By using existing elevation data Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) I was able to artificially recreate the data at this higher resolution. The data was derived from the same base grid which was computed at a horizontal resolution of 10 meters by interpolating the contour lines from the LINZ topographical database. I wrote custom software to perform the calculations which took two 6 core machines abou 1 week to complete. Information on the HGT (STRM1) format can be found [here](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/srtm/version2_1/Documentation/SRTM_Topo.pdf).
